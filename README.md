# ZettelDrop

ZettelDrop is a node app I am building to learn and practice a few different skills, some of which are brand new to me. Underlying tech includes these:
- Node
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

The app's function is to store bits of text data and allow the user to link them together and query them in a somewhat clever way.



## To-Do

- Testing. I Haven't figure out how to test Node apps yet.
- Build a frontend that interfaces with it.
